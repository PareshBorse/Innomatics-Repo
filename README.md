This project is a comprehensive data engineering and analytics study that integrates multi-format datasets—CSV, JSON, and SQL—to evaluate the performance of a food delivery platform. By merging transaction logs, user demographics, and restaurant metadata, the analysis provides a granular view of business health across various operational segments.

Key Insights and Findings
Revenue Drivers: The analysis identified Q3 (July–September) as the highest revenue-generating period. Among membership tiers and cuisine types, the Gold + Italian combination emerged as the top revenue contributor, highlighting the high value of premium subscribers in specific food categories.

Customer Segmentation: Users with Gold membership accounted for 4,987 orders, maintaining a significantly higher average order value of $797.15. This underscores the effectiveness of the loyalty program in driving higher spending.

Geographic Performance: Chennai leads as the top revenue-generating city for Gold members, while Hyderabad generated a total revenue of $1,889,367.

Restaurant Metrics: High-performing restaurants were identified by balancing order volume and value. Grand Cafe Punjabi recorded the highest average order value ($946.22) among restaurants with fewer than 20 orders, indicating a niche, high-ticket market. Additionally, 3,374 orders were placed at restaurants with a customer rating of 4.5 or higher.
